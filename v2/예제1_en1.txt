Title of the Invention
An Improved Decorative Member That Engages and Secures to a Protruding Accessory Part
Technical Field
This invention relates to an improved decorative member that engages and secures to a protruding accessory part.
Background Art
Decorative items used for apparel, bags, hats, etc., include brooches, tie pins, and the like. However, accessories such as buttons or handles that lack special decoration and are used only functionally tend to be biased toward functionality rather than design. To overcome this drawback, the applicant of this invention proposed Korean Patent Application No. 10-2018-0063100 "Decorative Item That Engages and Secures to a Protruding Part." The product in that application engages and secures to protrusions such as buttons, giving an entirely different impression from conventional use and allowing various decorations to be employed. However, the engaging aid (12) used in the above invention is circular; repeated insertion and removal of a button causes the introduction ring portion (19) to open laterally. When equal forces are applied from both sides, the central part of the engaging aid (12) experiences the greatest force and may fracture after long-term use. Moreover, when attaching the engaging aid (12) to the decorative body (11), the outer side of the wall joint (17) is covered with a cap for fixation, which not only requires substantial labor but also has the drawback that it can easily detach if the cap comes loose.
Content of the Invention
Problems to be Solved
This invention is made to solve the above problems and aims to provide a decorative member that can be hooked onto a protruding accessory shape, allowing various decorative items to be interchangeable. It also aims for high durability of parts fixed to a protruding accessory shape and ensures that such parts do not separate easily.## Means for Solving the Problem
To achieve the above objective, this invention provides an improved decorative member that fits into and locks onto a protruding accessory part. The decorative member of this invention comprises: (1) a decorative body (21) formed by arranging a top plate (11) and a bottom plate (12) opposite each other at predetermined intervals along a vertical wall (13) formed on part of the outer periphery of the top plate (11) and bottom plate (12); (2) an accessory fixing member (31) that is attached to the decorative body (21), bends a long strip into a ring while leaving one end open, and fits into the button‑fixed space created between the top plate (11) and bottom plate (12). The bottom plate (12) further includes an introduction portion (41) formed as a space extending from the exterior of the bottom plate (12) to its center so that a button can be inserted toward the center. The open end of the accessory fixing member (31) is positioned facing the direction in which the introduction portion (41) was formed.
At the junction where the line virtually connecting the direction of the introduced portion (41) intersects the vertical wall (13), a wall‑binding pin (51) is formed and inserted into a wall‑binding hole (61) created on the accessory fixing member (31). When the wall‑binding pin (51) is inserted into the wall‑binding hole (61), it can be prevented from being pulled out by forced insertion.
The accessory fixing member (31) also includes a horizontally formed fixing member horizontal part (62); the wall‑binding hole (61) is formed on this horizontal part. The fixing member curve portion (63) is arcuate from both ends of the horizontal part (62), allowing it to form an overall ring shape.
Where the horizontal part (62) contacts the vertical wall, a flat‑shaped fixing member joining surface (52) is formed so that the horizontal part (62) and the joining surface (52) can be tightly coupled. Above the top plate (11), another decorative part may optionally be attached.
Both ends of the accessory fixing member (31) have a vortex portion (32) wrapped outwardly, making the contact area with the button during insertion or removal a curved surface, thereby enabling easy insertion and removal. The decorative body (21) can be formed by injection molding. The vertical wall (13) may be formed around the entire outer periphery except for the introduction portion (41).A fixing member spacing part (64) is formed between the Fixing Member Horizontal Part (62) and the Fixing Member Curve Portion (63), thereby widening the gap between the Fixing Member Horizontal Part (62) and the Fixing Member Curve Portion (63) while increasing the elasticity created by the two Fixing Member Curve Portions (63).  【Effect of the Invention】
With the above configuration, in order to allow the protruding accessory part to be engaged and presented in various modes, the stress concentration on the Accessory Fixing Member is alleviated, thereby improving durability. Furthermore, by press‑fitting a Wall‑Binding Pin into a Wall‑Binding Hole, the number of parts can be reduced while suppressing loosening. As a result, stable fixation, easy removal and high ornamental deformability can be provided for the protruding portions of diverse fashion accessories and attachments.  【Brief Description of the Drawings】
Figures 1 to 5 illustrate embodiments of the present invention.  【Embodiment for Implementing the Invention】
Referring now to the accompanying drawings, a detailed description will be given. For convenience, the accessory used in fashion products is illustrated with a button as an example; however, the present invention is not limited to buttons.
The decorative body (21) of the present invention provides a vertical wall (13) between the Top Plate (11) and Bottom Plate (12), forming the Decorative Body (21) at a predetermined spacing. The Top Plate and Bottom Plate are facing flat plates that form an internal space where the Accessory Fixing Member (31) is positioned, and the Vertical Wall (13) integrates the two plates to impart structural rigidity.
The reason for forming the decorative body as a joint structure of plates and walls is to provide a stable button‑fixing space inside, ensuring that the button repeatedly settles at a fixed position. Moreover, by integrating the Top Plate and Bottom Plate with the Vertical Wall (13), resistance to torsion and bending during use increases, suppressing deformation during injection molding and ensuring dimensional accuracy, which is advantageous for mass production. However, if sufficient rigidity can be ensured, the Top Plate and Bottom Plate may also be manufactured separately and joined.
The Bottom Plate (12) has a continuous introduction portion (41) that extends from the outer perimeter to the center. The Introduction Portion (41) guides the button so that it naturally slides in from outside to inside, leading the button toward the central area where the Accessory Fixing Member (31) is positioned. The reason for providing the Introduction Portion as an open channel is that during attachment and removal, the user can immediately perceive the path visually or tactilely and insert quickly; the thread bound to the button passes through a specific location, reducing interference and easing wear.
The Accessory Fixing Member (31) is formed by bending a plate material in the longitudinal direction into an open‑ended ring shape. The flat Fixing Member Horizontal Part (62) presses against the Fixing Member Joining Surface (52), which has been flatly formed on the Vertical Wall (13). From each end of the Fixing Member Horizontal Part, the Fixing Member Curve Portion (63) continues and surrounds the button fixation space inside the Accessory Fixing Member (31). When used, the member elastically deforms so that its opening temporarily widens; it then returns to grip the button. In normal operation it supports part of the button’s perimeter by line contact or surface contact.

Unlike conventional designs, constructing the Accessory Fixing Member as a continuous shape comprising a horizontal part and a curve portion helps distribute stress along the Curve Portion during button insertion, thereby suppressing stress concentration at specific locations. Because the Horizontal Part lies flatly against a plane, its position reference becomes clear, and the set position remains stable even after repeated attachment and detachment. Moreover, a shape close to a closed ring ensures adequate restoring force, minimizing loss of clamping strength over long‑term use. If the Accessory Fixing Member (31) were made only from a curve—as in older designs—stress would concentrate at particular sites, leading to damage; forming a horizontal plane allows stress dispersion.

Both ends of the Fixing Member Curve Portion (63) are finished with a Vortex Portion (32) wound outward. The Vortex Portion curves the edges where the button’s corners contact the entrance and exit, reducing local friction and scratches, and guides the vertical component of reaction force along the surface. This round finish lets users push or pull the button smoothly with minimal effort, preventing damage to garments or accessories and preserving appearance quality.

On the Vertical Wall (13), a wall‑binding pin (51) is integrally formed at the intersection where a virtual line drawn from the direction of the Introduction Portion (41) meets the wall. A corresponding Wall‑Binding Hole (61) is formed in the Accessory Fixing Member (31). During assembly, the pin (51) is inserted into the hole (61) and secured by press‑fit deformation; after fastening, reverse pulling forces are suppressed. The pin‑hole press‑fit method eliminates the need for separate caps or screws, reduces part count, simplifies the assembly process to a single insertion action, and improves productivity. It also geometrically defines the relative position between the Vertical Wall and the Accessory Fixing Member, suppressing positional shift or play during long‑term use.The contact surface between the Vertical Wall (13) and the Accessory Fixing Member (31) is processed or molded flat as the Fixing Member Joining Surface (52), which comes into face‑contact with the Fixing Member Horizontal Part (62). To form a flat surface, it is acceptable to make the portion where the Fixing Member Joining Surface (52) is formed slightly thicker. The broader contact area resulting from face‑contact distributes the pressure over a larger region, reducing indentation and deformation; the entire joining surface restrains rotation and oscillation of the Accessory Fixing Member. Even when repeated insertion loads are applied, the Fixing Member Joining Surface (52) maintains its reference plane, ensuring reproducibility of the fastening position. Moreover, dimensional variation is reduced and post‑assembly noise and vibration can be prevented.

The Vertical Wall (13) is formed continuously along all or part of the outer peripheral surface except for the Introduction Portion (41), and may also be positioned slightly inside relative to the outer peripheral surface if necessary. By integrating the outer surfaces of the Top Plate (11) and Bottom Plate (12) with the Vertical Wall, a ring‑shaped closed‑curve structure is formed. The Vertical Wall increases the torsional stiffness of the main body, distributes the load transmitted to the Accessory Fixing Member across the entire body, and maintains a stable opening shape in the Button Fixation Space inside. This provides an outer‑peripheral reinforcement effect on a thin‑plate body, achieving a balance between lightweight and rigidity while selectively opening only around the Introduction Portion to ensure insertability.

The upper surface of the Top Plate (11) may be joined with a detachable decorative part. The upper surface covers the area where the button is hidden; even by itself it can provide decorative effect, but adding a removable decorative part allows for more diverse design options. Various joining methods such as clamping stages, protrusion‑groove, elastic tabs, and magnetic materials can be applied to the connection structure between the Top Plate and the decorative part. This structure offers diverse exterior deformations for each product group, enhancing user customization and market responsiveness while keeping the core fastening components unchanged; it also simplifies maintenance and cleaning by allowing only the exterior to be replaced. Using the same main body platform preserves economy.

The Decorative Body (21) can be formed by injection molding or similar processes. Injection molding allows complex three‑dimensional shapes to be integrated in a single part, minimizing assembly steps and stabilizing fit with the decorative part. It also reduces production cost and is suitable for mass production.In the operating condition, the button enters the bottom‑plate opening along the introduction portion (41), and when the button’s side contacts the vortex portion (32) the accessory fixing member (31) undergoes elastic deformation. When the button’s thickest rim passes through the fixing member curve portion (63), the accessory fixing member returns to its original shape; part of the button rim is supported from both sides by the inner wall of the fixing member curve portion and the vertical‑wall side, thereby suppressing rotation and oscillation. The user operation can be simplified to a push‑in motion in one direction followed by a pull‑out motion, allowing anyone to use it immediately. Thanks to the restoring force and elastic force of the fixing member, the decorative alignment remains stably maintained.

Furthermore, between the fixing member horizontal part (62) and the fixing member curve portion (63), a fixing member spacing part (64) is formed, increasing the distance between the horizontal part (62) and the curve portion (63). The spacing part (64) is generally formed perpendicular to the horizontal part (62), widening the gap between the horizontal part (62) and the curve portion (63); compared with having only a curved section, even at the same diameter this yields higher elasticity. If the component were fabricated solely in an arcuate shape without a spacing part (64), producing the accessory fixing member to match the decorative body’s (21) diameter would cause elastic weakening over long use, concentrating force near adjacent portions of the curve portion (63) and potentially leading to cracking.

In contrast, forming the fixing member horizontal part (62) distributes the forces acting on the curve portion (63) to both sides of the horizontal part. Moreover, by creating the spacing part (64), the circle formed by the curve portion (63) within the same decorative body becomes generally smaller, increasing its curvature and thereby achieving greater elasticity. In short, this design offers higher elasticity than conventional designs while potentially doubling durability.

Figure 7 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention: an example in which the top plate (11) is deformed into a decorative shape. The top plate (11) and bottom plate (12) can be used in various shapes. The accessory fixing member (31) is inserted between the top plate (11) and bottom plate (12), showing more clearly how the fixing member joining surface (52) and fixing member horizontal part (62) adhere and bind together, and also detailing how the wall‑binding pin (51) is inserted into the wall‑binding hole (61). Consequently, this embodiment binds more stably than conventional accessory fixing members (31), provides higher elasticity, and improves durability.From a manufacturing and materials perspective, the accessory fixing member (31) can be formed from metal or an elastic composite material that possesses spring characteristics, and a coating or plating treatment that reduces friction and corrosion may be applied to its surface. This material selection extends the fatigue life against repeated bending, reduces wear and contamination in contact with textile fibers, and suppresses discoloration of the appearance during long‑term use.

The decorative component of this invention can also be applied to various protrusions other than buttons, such as handles, lock parts on bags, corner protectors, etc. The shape of the introduction portion, the opening width of the accessory fixing member, and the curvature radius can be reasonably redesigned within a practical range according to the shape and elastic properties of the target accessory part. This versatility allows a single platform to cover multiple product groups, expanding the scope of application and enabling users to change only the decorative component to achieve diverse effects.
