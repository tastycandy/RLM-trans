**Title of the Invention**
Improved decorative element fixed by interlocking with a protruding accessory part

**Technical Field**
The present invention relates to an improved decorative element that is fixed by interlocking with a protruding accessory part.

**Background Art**
Decorative items used on clothing, bags, hats and other fashion goods include brooches, tie pins, etc. However, accessories such as buttons, handles, and other items that have no special decoration and are used only for functional purposes tend to be biased toward functionality rather than design. To overcome these shortcomings, the applicant of the present invention proposed Korean Patent Application No. 10-2018-0063100 “Decorative item fixed by interlocking with a protruding part.” The product in that application provides a completely different impression from conventional usage by fixing it to the protruding part of items such as buttons, thereby enabling the use of various decorations. However, because the interlocking auxiliary device (12) used in the above invention is circular, repeated insertion and removal of a button causes the introduction ring portion (19) to open laterally. If equal forces are applied from both sides, the central part of the interlocking auxiliary device (12) receives the greatest force, which may lead to fracture after long-term use. Also, the interlocking auxiliary device (12) is used as a decorative item.【Means for solving the problem】

In order to achieve the foregoing purpose, this invention provides an improved decorative member that is interlocked with and fixed to a protruding auxiliary part. The decorative member of this invention comprises: a decorative body (21) formed by aligning a top plate (11) and a bottom plate (12) opposite each other at predetermined intervals separated by a vertical wall (13) formed along part of the peripheral surface of the top plate (11) and the bottom plate (12); an auxiliary fixing member (31), which is coupled to the decorative body (21) and is a long sheet that is curved into a circular shape while one end remains open, forming an open-circular member that fits into the button‑fixed space formed between the top plate (11) and the bottom plate (12). The bottom plate (12) has a guide portion (41) formed as a space extending from the exterior of the bottom plate (12) to the central part of the bottom plate (12) along the direction in which a button is inserted, so that the button is positioned at the center of the bottom plate (12). The open end portion of the auxiliary fixing member (31) is arranged to face toward the direction in which the guide portion (41) is formed. At the intersection between a line virtually connecting the direction in which the guide portion (41) is formed and the vertical wall (13), a wall‑binding pin (51) is formed, and it is inserted into a wall‑binding hole (61) formed on the auxiliary fixing member (31). The wall‑binding pin (51) ...A spacer (64) is formed between the horizontal portion of the fastener (62) and the curved portion of the fastener (63), thereby widening the spacing between the horizontal portion of the fastener (62) and the curved portion of the fastener (63) while increasing the elasticity generated by the curved portions of the fastener on both sides.  

【Effect of the Invention】  
By virtue of the above configuration, it becomes possible to engage with protruding accessory parts and render them in a variety of manners; the stress concentration of the accessory fasteners is alleviated, thereby improving durability. Furthermore, by means of an interlocking pin (wall‑bonding pin) and an interlocking hole (wall‑bonding hole) engaged by press‑fitting, the number of components can be reduced while suppressing loosening. As a result, stable fixation, easy removal and attachment, and high ornamental deformability can be provided for protruding portions of various fashion goods and accessories.  

【Brief Description of Drawings】  
Figures 1 through 5 are drawings illustrating an embodiment of the present invention.  

【Embodiment of the Invention】  
The following detailed description is given with reference to the attached drawings. For convenience of explanation, a button is used as an example of an accessory employed in fashion products; however, the present invention is not limited to buttons. The decorative member of the present invention forms a vertical wall (13) between an upper plate (11) and a lower plate (12), providing a decorative body (21) formed by two plates separated by a predetermined spacing. The upper plate and the lower plate face each other.The auxiliary fixation member (31) is formed by bending a plate material in the longitudinal direction so that one end is opened to form a circular shape. The flat-shaped horizontal portion of the fixation member (62) abuts against the fixation member coupling surface (52), which has been flatly formed on the vertical wall (13); from both ends of the horizontal portion (62) the curved portion of the fixation member (63) continuously forms, thereby surrounding the button fixing space formed within the auxiliary fixation member (31). The auxiliary fixation member (31) elastically deforms during use so that its opening temporarily widens, then restores to grasp and fix the button; in a normal state it supports part of the periphery of the button by line contact or surface contact. Unlike prior art, the reason for constructing the auxiliary fixation member as a continuous shape comprising a horizontal portion and a curved portion is to disperse stress along the curved portion when inserting the button, thereby suppressing stress concentration at specific locations. Moreover, because the horizontal portion abuts against a flat plane, the positional reference becomes clear, and even after repeated attachment and detachment the set position changes little. Furthermore, by adopting a shape close to the closed curve of the ring, the restoring force is ensured, minimizing reduction in clamping force even with long-term use. If the auxiliary fixation member (31) were formed only with a curved portion as in prior art, stress would concentrate at specific locations and it would be prone to breakage; by forming a horizontal plane, stress can be dispersed. The two ends of the curved portion of the fixation member (63) are wound outward.The contact surface between the vertical wall (13) and the auxiliary fastening member (31) is processed or molded flat as a fastening member bonding surface (52), and it contacts with the horizontal part of the fastening member (62). In order to form the flat surface, the portion where the fastening member bonding surface (52) is formed may be made slightly thicker. By contacting the surfaces, the contact pressure is dispersed over a wide area, reducing scuff marks and deformation, and the entire bonding surface suppresses rotation and vibration of the auxiliary fastening member. Moreover, even when repeated insertion loads are applied, the fastening member bonding surface (52) maintains the reference plane, ensuring reproducibility of the clamping position. Furthermore, dimensional variation can be reduced, and noise and vibration after assembly can also be prevented.

The vertical wall (13) is formed continuously along all or part of the outer peripheral surface except for the introduction portion (41), and if necessary it may be formed slightly inside relative to the outer peripheral surface. By means of the vertical wall (13), the outer peripheral surfaces of the upper plate (11) and lower plate (12) are integrated with the vertical wall, forming a ring-shaped closed curve structure. The vertical wall increases the twist rigidity of the main body, distributes the load transmitted to the auxiliary fastening member over the entire main body, and can stably maintain the opening shape of the internal button fixing space. This provides an outer peripheral reinforcement effect for a thin plate-like main body, achieving a balance between lightweight and stiffness while selectively opening only around the introduction portion to ensure insertability.In the operating condition, the button is advanced through the opening of the lower board along the introduction part (41), and as the side of the button contacts the vortex part (32), the ancillary fastener (31) elastically deforms. When the thickest periphery of the button passes through the curved portion of the fastener (63), the ancillary fastener returns to its original shape, and a portion of the button periphery is supported from both sides by the inner wall of the fastener curved portion and the vertical sidewall, thereby suppressing rotation and oscillation. The user's operation can be simplified to pushing in one direction and pulling out, enabling anyone to use it immediately; with the restorative force and elastic force of the fastener, the decorative alignment state is stably maintained. Furthermore, a fastener spacing part (64) is formed between the fastener horizontal part (62) and the fastener curved portion (63), increasing the spacing between the fastener horizontal part (62) and the fastener curved portion (63). The fastener spacing part (64) is generally formed vertically from the fastener horizontal part (62) and, by widening the spacing between the fastener horizontal part (62) and the fastener curved portion (63), provides higher elasticity even at the same diameter compared with a configuration having only the curved portion. If the fastener spacing part (64) is omitted and the device is made solely in an arcuate shape, producing the ancillary fastener to match the diameter of the decorative body (21) will result in weakened elasticity after long-term use, causing the fastener curved portions (63) to come close together.From a manufacturing and material standpoint, the auxiliary fastener (31) may be formed from metal or an elastic composite material possessing spring characteristics, and a surface coating or plating treatment that reduces friction and corrosion may also be applied. This material selection extends the fatigue life against repeated bending, reduces wear and contamination in contact with textile fibers, and suppresses discoloration during long‑term use.

The decorative member of the present invention can be applied not only to buttons but also to various protrusions such as handles, bag locking sections, corner protectors, etc. The shape of the insertion portion, the opening width of the auxiliary fastener, and the radius of curvature may be reasonably designed within a practical range in accordance with the shape and material elasticity of the target auxiliary part. This versatility allows a single platform to cover multiple product lines, expanding the scope of application, and enables users to replace only the decorative member to achieve diverse effects.
